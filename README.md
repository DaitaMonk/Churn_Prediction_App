# <center>Building an Interactive Churn Prediction App with Gradio</center>

## Introduction

Predicting customer churn is crucial for businesses, and machine learning models can be valuable tools for this task. In this article, we'll walk you through the process of creating an interactive churn prediction app using the Gradio library. Gradio simplifies the development of user interfaces for machine learning models, making it accessible even to those without extensive web development knowledge.

## Objective

Develop a user-friendly data app using gradio, an open-source Python library for creating web applications that predicts Customer Churn (Classification) with minimal effort. The app will provide an intuitive interface for users to interact with and visualize data.

## What is Gradio

Gradio is an open-source Python library that simplifies the process of creating user interfaces for machine learning models. It provides a simple and intuitive way to build interactive web-based interfaces for your ML models without requiring extensive knowledge of web development or UI design.
